              Responsive to the dramatic topography of the Sahyadhri mountains, this residence is conceived not as a static object, but as a series of cascading platforms that negotiate the steep terrain. The architecture creates a deliberate 'play of levels,' using a split-level section to minimize cut-and-fill while creating distinct zones of privacy and gathering.

The design is anchored by a deep, protective mono-pitch roof—essential for the region's heavy monsoon rains—which extends to shelter generous semi-open verandahs. We strategically placed expansive openings and cantilevered balconies to frame the sweeping valley views, ensuring that every level maintains a unique visual dialogue with the landscape. The interplay of vertical volumes, exposed brick/stone elements, and double-height voids brings natural light deep into the core of the home, balancing the heavy grounding of the structure with a sense of internal airiness.
