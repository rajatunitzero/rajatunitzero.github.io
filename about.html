Studio Unit Zero is a collaborative architectural design initiative founded by three designers with a 
shared interest in architectural exploration, research, and conceptual practice.

The studio functions as an independent platform for developing early access and exploratory projects, 
allowing for focused investigations into spatial systems, material relationships, and architectural ideas. 
Our work emphasizes process-driven design, where drawings, models, and visual studies form the 
basis of architectural inquiry.

Studio Unit Zero operates alongside professional practice, serving as a space for experimentation and 
collaboration outside of employment-based work. All projects presented on this website are independently 
produced by the studio and do not represent the work, views, or intellectual property of any firm or 
organization the members are/were professionally associated with.

Through this platform, the studio seeks to engage in catering to design and share a body of work that reflects our collective 
approach to architecture - rooted in curiosity, rigor, and thoughtful design.
