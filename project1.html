              A unique business brief was laid out to us.
              During the day, the space functions as a bright, airy Academy Café, offering nutritional
              menus for athletes and a viewing gallery for parents and spectators. 
              As night arrives, through integrated smart lighting and
              modular furniture, the space transitions into a sophisticated
              Restobar.

              The central structure is a high-ceilinged, open-plan pavilion that
              houses the culinary program.
              The acoustic design allows for high-energy music near
              the casual pool while maintaining intimate lounge pockets within the interior. 
              The Roof System: A simple corrugated or
              color-coated steel sheet is utilized for its durability and rapid
              installation.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The architectural identity is defined by a
              high-strength steel frame that serves as the "backbone" of thefacility. 
              This system is leveraged for its high strength-to-weight
              ratio, allowing for the large-span, column-free spaces essential
              for an unobstructed view of both the semi-olympic training lanes
              and the casual event pool.

              To soften the industrial nature of the steel, the
              structure can be integrated with exposed timber accents or slats,
              creating a "resort-industrial" look. This interplay of materials
              allows the building to feel professional during daytime academy
              hours and sophisticated when the restobar lights take over at
              night.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lightweight nature of the steel structure allows for the easy
              suspension of event-specific equipment, such as professional sound
              systems, DJ lighting, and festive decorations for high-impact
              events like Holi.
